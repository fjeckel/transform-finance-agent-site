# Episode Translation Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
Episode descriptions and content were not showing in English (or other languages) when users switched languages, even though the translation system was properly set up in the database.

## Root Cause
The episode display components were using the wrong hooks that only fetch original German content instead of localized content:

1. **Episodes.tsx** and **Discover.tsx** were using `useEpisodes()` from `/hooks/useEpisodes.ts`
2. **DynamicEpisode.tsx** was using `useEpisodeBySlug()` 
3. None of these components were using the multilingual hooks from `useMultilingualEpisodes.ts`
4. The hooks didn't receive language context from i18n
5. No query invalidation on language changes

## Fixed Components

### 1. Episodes.tsx
- ✅ Changed from `useEpisodes()` to `useLocalizedEpisodes(i18n.language)`
- ✅ Added i18n context: `const { t, i18n } = useTranslation()`
- ✅ Updated data destructuring to match new hook API

### 2. Discover.tsx  
- ✅ Changed from `useEpisodes()` to `useLocalizedEpisodes(i18n.language)`
- ✅ Added useTranslation import and i18n context
- ✅ Updated data destructuring

### 3. DynamicEpisode.tsx
- ✅ Changed from `useEpisodeBySlug()` to `useLocalizedEpisodeBySlug(slug, i18n.language)`
- ✅ Added i18n context: `const { t, i18n } = useTranslation()`

### 4. LanguageSwitcher.tsx
- ✅ Added query invalidation on language switch
- ✅ Invalidates all localized content queries when language changes
- ✅ Ensures immediate UI updates

## How the Fix Works

### Before (Broken):
```typescript
// Only fetches German content, ignores language switching
const { episodes } = useEpisodes();
```

### After (Fixed):
```typescript  
// Fetches content in current language, with fallback to German
const { i18n } = useTranslation();
const { data: episodes = [] } = useLocalizedEpisodes(i18n.language);
```

### Translation Logic:
The `useLocalizedEpisodes` hook:
1. Fetches base episodes in German
2. Fetches translations for the specified language
3. Merges them, using translations where available
4. Falls back to German content if no translation exists
5. Returns episodes with proper `is_translated` flags

### Language Switch Flow:
1. User clicks language switcher
2. `i18n.changeLanguage(newLanguage)` is called
3. All localized queries are invalidated via `queryClient.invalidateQueries()`
4. Hooks re-fetch data for the new language
5. UI updates with translated content

## Database Structure
The fix leverages the existing `episodes_translations` table:
- `episode_id`: Links to the original episode
- `language_code`: Target language ('en', 'fr', 'es', etc.)
- `title`, `description`, `content`, `summary`: Translated fields
- `translation_status`: Must be 'completed', 'approved', 'draft', or 'pending'

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Add Sample Translations
Use the provided `sample_translations.sql` to add English/French translations for testing.

### 2. Test Language Switching  
1. Go to any episode page
2. Switch language using the language switcher
3. Episode content should immediately update to show translated versions
4. If no translation exists, original German content is shown

### 3. Verify on Different Pages
- ✅ Episodes list page (`/episodes`)
- ✅ Individual episode pages (`/episode/[slug]`)  
- ✅ Discover page latest episode display
- ✅ Episode carousels and cards

## RLS Policies
The database RLS policies allow:
- **Public users**: Can read `approved` translations for `published` episodes
- **Authenticated users**: Can read all translation statuses
- This ensures proper content visibility based on translation quality

## Performance Considerations
- ✅ React Query caching prevents unnecessary API calls
- ✅ Language included in query keys for proper cache separation  
- ✅ Selective query invalidation (only translation-related queries)
- ✅ Fallback mechanism prevents broken UI if translations missing

## Future Enhancements
1. **Loading States**: Add language-specific loading indicators
2. **Translation Quality**: Show translation quality scores to users
3. **Auto-translation**: Integrate with OpenAI for automatic translations
4. **SEO**: Update meta tags and URLs for multilingual content

The episode translation system is now fully functional and reactive to language changes. Users will see translated content immediately when switching languages, with proper fallbacks to German when translations are not available.
